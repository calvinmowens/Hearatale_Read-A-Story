## Install Guide
**Pre-requisites:** 
what is the required configuration of software and hardware that the customer must have before they can begin the installation process?
**Dependencies:**
what third party software must be installed for your software to function?
**Download instructions:** how will the customer and users get access to the project?
**Build instructions (if needed):** if you are providing the raw source code rather than a binary build, how will the customer and users create the required executable application?
Installation of actual application: what steps have to be taken after the software is built? What directories are required for installation?
**Run instructions:**  what does the user/customer have to do to get the software to execute?
**Troubleshooting:**  what are common errors that occur during installation and what is the corrective action?


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Testing Login:** CCCCC

## Avaliable Scripts && React Docs

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
