'Once upon a time a family of bears lived together in a house of their own in a wood. First there was Baby Bear who was the smallest, and next Momma Bear who was medium sized, and last came Poppa Bear, who was the biggest.  They had each a bowl for their porridge, a little bowl for Baby Bear, and a middle-sized bowl for Momma Bear, and a great big bowl for Poppa Bear. And they had each a chair to sit in, a little chair for Baby Bear; and a middle-sized chair for Momma Bear; and a great big chair for Poppa Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in, a little bed for Baby Bear; and a middle-sized bed for Momma Bear; and a great big bed for Poppa Bear. \\n One day, after Momma Bear had made the hot porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, so that they wouldn’t burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it. \\n And while they were walking, Goldilocks came to the house, but there was no one to be seen.  First, she looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at the keyhole, and, seeing nobody in the house, she opened the door. The door was not locked because the bears were good bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would bother them. So Goldilocks opened the door and went in, and was very well pleased when she saw the porridge on the table. Goldilocks should have waited till the bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have invited her to breakfast; for they were good bears—perhaps a little rough, as the way of bears is, but still very good-natured and hospitable. But Goldilocks was an impatient little girl, and not as polite as she should have been, and she set about helping herself. \\n So first she tasted the porridge of Poppa Bear, and that was too hot for her.  And then she tasted the porridge of Momma Bear; and that was too cold for her.  And finally she went to Baby Bear’s porridge, and tasted that, and that was just right.  And Goldilocks liked it so well, that she ate it all up and left the bowl empty. \\n Then Goldilocks sat down in Poppa Bear’s chair, and that was too hard for her. And then she sat down in Momma Bear’s chair, and that was too soft for her.  And then she sat down in Baby Bear’s chair, and that was just right, so there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came she, plump upon the ground. \\n Then Goldilocks went up stairs into the bedroom in which the three bears slept. And first she lay down upon Poppa Bear’s bed, but there were too many covers.  And next she lay down upon Momma Bear’s bed, but there weren’t enough covers. And then she lay down upon Baby Bear’s bed, and that was just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep. \\n By this time the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast. Now Goldilocks had left Poppa Bear’s wooden spoon standing in his porridge, and when he saw it he said his great gruff voice, “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN EATING MY PORRIDGE!” \\n And when Momma Bear looked at hers, she saw that her silver spoon was standing in it too, and in her sweet voice she said, “Somebody has been eating my porridge!” \\n Then Baby Bear looked at his, and there was the little spoon in the porridge bowl, but the porridge was all gone, and in his little, small, wee voice Baby Bear said, “Somebody has been eating my porridge, and has eaten it all up!” \\n When they noticed all this the three bears realized that someone had come into their house and bothered their things and they began to look all around them.  Now Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she got up from Poppa Bear’s chair, and in his great gruff voice he said, “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!” \\n And Goldilocks had squatted down Momma Bear’s soft cushion and in her sweet voice she said, “Somebody has been sitting in my chair!” \\n And you know what Goldilocks had done to the third chair, and in his little, small, wee voice Baby Bear said, “Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has broken it all to pieces!” \\n Then the three bears thought they needed to make a careful search, so they went up stairs into their bedroom.  Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of Poppa Bear out of its place, and when he saw that Poppa Bear said in his great gruff voice, “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!” \\n And Goldilocks had left a hollow empty place in Momma Bear’s bed, and in her sweet voice she said, “Somebody has been lying in my bed!” \\n And when Baby Bear came to look at his bed, there wasn’t a hollow empty place but a round high place under the cover, and there was the pillow in its place but it wasn’t empty, for there upon the pillow was Goldilocks’s face covered by her golden hair, and in his little, small, wee voice Baby Bear said, “Somebody has been lying in my bed, there she is!” \\n Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of Poppa Bear, but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to her than the roaring of wind or the rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the sweet voice of Momma Bear, but it was only as if she had heard birds singing in a dream. But when she heard the little, small, wee voice of Baby Bear, it was so surprising that it awakened her at once. Up she popped, and when she saw the three bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other side, and ran to the window.  Now the window was open, because the bears, like good, tidy bears as they were, always opened their bedroom window when they got up in the morning. Out Goldilocks jumped and she ran away as fast as her legs would carry her, and the three little bears never ever saw again even one little golden hair of her golden locks. \\n';\n\n    let triggeredWord;\n\n    const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);\n    const [choosenWord, setChoosenWord] = useState('');\n\n    const handleWordClick = (event) => {\n        setIsVisible(!isVisible);\n        console.log(event.target.innerHTML);\n        setChoosenWord(event.target.innerHTML);\n    };\n\n    const onClose = () => {\n        setIsVisible(false);\n    };\n    useEffect(() => {\n\n        /**\n         * Plays audio.\n         */\n        let sound = document.getElementById(\"story\");\n        let btnChecker = document.getElementById(\"closeBtn\");\n\n        if (btnChecker != null) {\n            togglePlay();\n        } else {\n            togglePlay();\n        }\n\n        function togglePlay() {\n            return sound.paused ?

They lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. \\n \"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don\\'t go into Mr. McGregor\\'s garden. Your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.  Now run along and don\\'t get into mischief. I am going out.\" \\n Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the baker\\'s.  She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. \\n Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail who were good little bunnies went down the lane together to gather blackberries. \\n But Peter who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\\'s garden and squeezed under the gate! \\n First he ate some lettuces and some French beans, and then \\n He. Ate. Some. Radishes. \\n And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. \\n But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! \\n Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out \"Stop thief!\" \\n Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  He lost one shoe among the cabbages, and the other amongst the potatoes. \\n After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.  It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. \\n Peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself. \\n Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop on the top of Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in time. \\n Leaving his jacket behind him, he rushed into the tool-shed and— jumped into a can.  It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. \\n Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.  He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. \\n Presently Peter sneezed \"Kertyschoo!\"  Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. \\n Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. \\n After a time he began to wander about, going \\n lippity— \\n lippity— \\n not very fast and looking all around. \\n He found a door in a wall; but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth she could not answer. She only shook her head at him.  Peter began to cry. \\n Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her.  He had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. \\n He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.  Peter scuttered underneath the bushes, but presently as nothing happened, he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.  The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter and beyond him was the gate! \\n Peter got down very quietly off the wheel-barrow and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some blackcurrant bushes. \\n Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. \\n Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. \\n Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree. \\n He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes. \\n His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.  It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! \\n I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter! \"One teaspoonful to be taken at bedtime.\" \\n But...

She shaped him on her baking pan, with two arms and two legs, two nice big raisins for eyes, and a stripe of pink icing for a mouth, and sprinkled him all over with ginger spice, but she didn’t know a mischievous pixie had sprinkled some magic pixie dust in her ginger sprinkling can. \\n The grandmother slid the pan into the oven, and let it bake, but when opened the oven door, she had hardly set the pan on the table when the gingerbread man hopped up, winked a raisin eye, and said, “Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n He hopped off the table, skipped over the cat’s food dish, and squeezed out where the door had just barely cracked open as the grandfather was walking in. \\n “Stop!” shouted the grandfather.  “Please let me have a nibble!” \\n “Never!” laughed the gingerbread man as he raced away.  “I ran away from your wife and I’ll run away from you.  Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n The grandfather chased after him, with the grandmother just behind.   The cat swatted at him as he ran past, and meowed, “Please stop!  I only want one quick lick!” \\n “No icky lick for you, whisker face,” called the gingerbread man.  “I’m faster than your master and faster than your mistress and most of all I’m faster than you.  Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n A few steps farther and the gingerbread man could have jumped over the sleeping dog’s tale, but instead he leapt up high and landed square in the middle of it.  “Rowwrrrr!” the dog growled, starting up in surprise. \\n “Gotcha, you flea-bitten sack of bones,” called the gingerbread man. \\n “I’ll snatch a bite out of you,” barked the dog. \\n “Says you,” and the gingerbread man made a rude sound blubbering air between his tongue and his lips.  “You’re too slow!  You’re slow like your master and your mistress and even slower than the cat!  Run, run, fast as you can!  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n The dog chased after him, ahead of the cat and the grandpa and the grandma, but the gingerbread man sped easily ahead of them all, down past the barn where a cow was drowsing away, slowly chewing its cud.  Just as he whisked by the cow glanced up and mooed, “Stop, please let me have a nibble!” \\n “Forget about it!” The gingerbread man laughed and stuck out his tongue. “Your master can’t catch me, nor your mistress, nor the cat, nor dog, nor you!” \\n “Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n The cow trotted after him, with the dog and cat and grandfather and grandmother following, and away the gingerbread man fled, past a horse grazing on clover and alfalfa grass in the pasture. \\n “You smell delicious,” neighed the horse.  “May I please take just a tiny nip?” \\n “No way, hay breath!” shouted the gingerbread man, laughing.  “I can outrun your master and mistress and the cat and dog and cow, and I can outrun you.  Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n The horse cantered after him, with the cow trotting behind, and the dog and cat following, and grandfather and grandmother huffing and puffing trying to keep up. \\n A shepherd boy out watching over the sheep was feeling very hungry, wishing it were dinner time, when the gingerbread man flashed past him.  “Stop!” shouted the boy.  “Please stop!  I must have just one bite!” \\n “In your dreams!” called the gingerbread man, and he hopped backward a few steps to make a funny face as the boy raced to catch him. \\n “Nobody can catch me—grandad, grandma, cat, dog, cow, horse—and not some goofy-looking, flat-footed shepherd boy!  Run, run, fast as you can!  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n On he raced, grinning and cocky, until he came to a river, and then he halted, for he knew he couldn’t swim in the water. \\n Then over by a blackberry bush he spotted a red fox curled with its fluffy tail brushing its nose.  The gingerbread man thought about racing down the river side to look for a bridge. \\n “Don’t even think about it, fox!” he said.  “You’re too slow for me.  Run, run, fast as you can.  You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” \\n But the fox said calmly, “Don’t worry, gingerbread man.   I’ve just dined on a fine fat rabbit, so why would I need to eat you?” \\n Then he stood and took a step forward.  “Do you need a way across the river?” \\n “Maybe I do,” said the gingerbread man, “and maybe I don’t.” \\n “Well,” said the fox, taking another step forward, “just hop on my tail.  I can lift you above the water as I swim across.” \\n The gingerbread man thought a minute, and listened to the sounds of the shepherd boy and horse and cow and dog and cat and grandfather and grandmother racing to catch him. \\n “Okay,” he said.  “But no tricks!” \\n He hopped on the fox’s bushy tail and the fox swam out a little way into the river. \\n “My tail’s getting wet and sinking in the river,” said the fox. “Hop up on my back and stay dry.”  So the gingerbread man hopped on the fox’s back. \\n Then, when they’d gone halfway across, the fox said, “The river water is splashing on my back.  Hop up on my head so you don’t get wet.”  So the gingerbread man hopped up between the fox’s ears. \\n They were nearly to the shore when the fox said, “I’m tired and can’t keep my whole head up any longer.  Hop on the tip of my nose to stay dry.”  The gingerbread man hopped on the tip of the fox’s nose.

He thought, ‘I wish the wolf would come and chase the sheep.  I could blow my horn and yell, “Wolf!  Wolf!” and all the people would race here and it would be interesting and fun.’  He knew he shouldn’t, but he was so bored he put the horn to his mouth, blew as hard as he could, and yelled, “The wolf has come!  The wolf has come!” \\n  In the town below he saw people grabbing their axes and clubs and guns and racing up the path to help him save the flock of sheep.  “Where is he?” they shouted.  “Did he kill any lambs?  Where’s the wolf?” \\n The boy was embarrassed then, but when the people saw the sheep peacefully munching on the grass and couldn’t find any wolf tracks, the boy had to admit the wolf hadn’t come at all and he was only pretending.  The villagers were angry and scolded him and made him feel ashamed, but he promised he’d never, ever again sound a false alarm, and the people left him alone with the sheep. \\n A few days later he felt bored again and wanted to blow the horn again and watch all the people gather their weapons and tools and race up the hill toward him.  He saw a shadow in some bushes and hoped it might be the wolf, and just in case it was, he decided to blow the horn, and he did, and again the people gathered up their rakes and hoes and long knives and guns and raced up the path as fast as they could. \\n But again the sheep peacefully grazed on the grass and no one found any sign of a wolf’s footprint or any wolf hair stuck on the bushes or briers.  This time no one scolded him.  They only stared hard and frowned with angry faces, and turned their backs on him and walked away.   The boy felt very sad and very ashamed and made a strong promise to himself that he’d never ever again blow the horn until he was very sure and very certain he really, really saw the wolf. \\n The very next day he saw something dark like a furry tail moving behind some rocks, and then a little later a shiny black nose peeking from the bushes, and a few minutes later two dark, furry, pointy ears poking up from behind a fallen log.  The boy wanted to blow the horn, but didn’t dare yet—then suddenly the wolf exploded forward leaping from a rock to attack a lamb and drag it in the bushes.  The boy blew the horn louder than he’d ever blown it before and yelled at the top of his lungs, “Wolf! Wolf!  The wolf has come!” \\n But down in the village no one reached for an axe or a rake or ran into a house to fetch a gun or big knife.  No one started up the path to help him.  It was as if he’d never blown the horn or cried “Wolf” at all.  The wolf ran across the field and caught another lamb, and again the boy blew his horn and cried “Wolf!  Wolf!” but again no one listened or paid attention or even looked up. \\n Fearful, his heart beating fast, watching to see if the wolf would chase after him, the boy ran down the path to the village shouting, “The wolf has come!  He’s killing the lambs!  Why didn’t you come when I cried wolf?” \\n When the people saw how afraid he was many of them grabbed their guns and knives and clubs to race up the path to drive away the wolf.  But an old woman stayed behind and looked at him sternly, and said, “You cried wolf once and lied to us for the wolf had not come.  You cried wolf again and lied again for again there was no wolf.

The eldest brother was Big Billy Goat Gruff, the second was Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff, and the youngest was Little Billy Goat Gruff.  Every day they grazed and browsed and munched to their hearts’ content, but they were hungry Billy Goats Gruff and before long they had eaten almost all the alfalfa on their hill. \\n On another hill across the way they could see fine meadow fields with red and white blossoms among delicious green clover, but the path to the other hill led down to a bridge and below the bridge lurked a mischievous troll. \\n One day Little Billy Goat Gruff tired of searching for grass to eat and went down the path to the bridge.  He looked around and didn’t see the troll, so he started across the bridge with his little hoofs going clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.  But when he reached the middle of the bridge he saw a crooked, bumpy finger with a pointy, broken fingernail curl up over the side of the bridge, and then another and another, until a whole dirty hand-paw slapped on the bridge and then another, and then a long greenish hairy nose like a lizard slid onto the bridge, and then reddish eyes and a wrinkly forehead and long-dirty hair, and up came the head until the chin rested on the bridge and big floppy lips and dirty black teeth that smelled terribly foul. \\n “And who are you clip-clopping across my bridge?” growled the troll. \\n “It is only I, Little Billy Goat Gruff,” said the little goat. \\n “Well, you’re tromping across my bridge and I’m going to eat you up!” said the troll, and his green and yellow tongue licked across the broken teeth. \\n “Please don’t eat me up,” said Little Billy Goat Gruff.  “I’m just a small little goat, barely enough for a snack.  If you let me go eat the clover on the other hill, I’ll get bigger and bigger.  You should wait for my brother Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff—he’s much bigger, and will make a much finer meal.” \\n “Well,” growled the troll, “all right.  Go along with you now and get bigger and I’ll eat you later.” \\n So Little Billy Goat Gruff continued on to the hill with the fresh clover. \\n A little while later Middle-size Billy Goat Gruff came down the path and started across the bridge going Clip-Clop, Clip-Clop, Clip-Clop.  About halfway across the bridge he saw pointy fingers like snakes creep up on the bridge, and a bumpy hand, and another, and a gruesome, ugly face appeared, with a long green nose with a pink wart that had a three long black hairs growing out of it, and big, floppy ears that waved in the breeze and made a shadow on the bridge. \\n “And who are you Clip-Clopping across my bridge?” growled the troll. \\n “It is only I, Middle-size Billy Goat Gruff,” said the middle brother. \\n “Well, you’re tromping across my bridge and I’m going to eat you up!” said the troll, and he slobbered slimy slobs of spit on the bridge. \\n “Please don’t eat me up,” said Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff.  “I’m just a middle-sized goat, enough for a nice snack, but not enough for a good meal.  If you let me go eat the clover on the other hill, I’ll get bigger and bigger.  You should wait for my brother Big Billy Goat Gruff—he’s much bigger, and will make a much finer supper.” \\n “Well,” growled the troll, “all right.  Go along with you now and get bigger and I’ll eat you later.\" \\n So Middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff continued on to the hill and joined his little brother grazing and munching on the fresh clover. \\n A little while later Big Billy Goat Gruff came down the path and started across the bridge going CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.  About the midpoint of the bridge he saw some muddy, scratchy fingers curl up over the edge of the bridge, and a horrible green face with red eyes popped up, and the troll said, “Who are you CLIP-CLOPPING across my bridge?” \\n “It is I,” replied the eldest brother, “Big Billy Goat Gruff.” \\n “Well,” said the troll.  “You’re a nice, big goat and I intend to eat you up.”  With that he swung the rest of his ugly body up on the bridge and there he stood, the ugliest troll in the kingdom, with dirty long black hair stuck to the mud all over his body, and hairy warts all over this chest, and ugly scabs on his arms and legs, and nasty weeds growing from the dirt deep in his tummy-button, and toenails that curled in circles till they made a sharp point and scratched lines in the bridge whenever he moved his foot. \\n “And after I eat you up,” growled the troll, “I intend to gobble up both your brothers.” \\n Big Billy Goat Gruff didn’t say a word.

The Lion went “Roarrrr!” leapt up, and with his paw he pinned the mouse’s tail. \\n “You ruined my nap!” said the Lion. “So now you get to be my dessert.” \\n The Mouse trembled with fear when the huge Lion’s eyes glared at him and the Lion flicked his long tongue across his teeth. \\n “Please, sir,” said the Mouse, “if you will spare my life, you can be sure that I’ll repay your kindness and do you a favor when you need one.” \\n “Hah!” said the Lion.  “How could a tiny little nobody like you ever do a favor for the great King of Beasts?”The Mouse couldn’t answer, because he didn’t know. \\n The Lion just sniffed and said, “You’re too small even for a good snack.” Then he lifted his claw off the mouse’s tail, and away the mouse scampered. \\n The very next day some hunters captured the lion in a big net and hung him from the palm tree.  The Lion heaved and thrashed and growled and roared but the net held him tight and there was no way he could escape. \\n The Mouse heard him roar, scampered up, and saw the Lion hanging in the net.  Quick as a wink he hopped from a big rock onto the net. \\n “I hope you didn’t come to make fun of me,” said the Lion. \\n “No,” said the Mouse.  “I came to help you, just like I promised.” \\n The Mouse hopped to the top of the Lion’s head, found a good place right between the Lion’s big furry ears, and nipped at the rope, and chewed and gnawed, biting through a few of the threads that made the rope, then a few more, and then a few more until finally the rope snapped and the net tumbled to the ground.  The Lion quickly squeezed free and raced off, the Mouse still clinging tight between the Lion’s ears. \\n When they came to a safe place the Lion stopped and said, “Thank you.  I’m sorry I teased you and made fun of the idea that somebody as little as you could ever help anybody as big as me.

Her wheels went around very fast, squealing along on the track.  Choo, choo!  Choo, choo!  Choo, choo!  She was happy because she was carrying that load of toys for the children and she had just enough time to get to the end of her journey before the last Christmas shopping. \\n But all of a sudden, bang!  Right at the foot of the mountain the Little Engine broke down!  Chug!  Chug!  Squeak!  The wheels slid along the track and then stood perfectly still.  She couldn’t go an inch further.  And how in the world could she ever get across the mountains now in time for the children’s Christmas? \\n Rag dolls, paper dolls, china dolls, little toy wagons and carts, dolls’ houses and Noah’s arks, tops and bats and balls—they were all to stay packed away useless, and the children on the other side to go without them for Christmas?  The little Train felt very sad as she stood there hoping for help.  Then suddenly, toot, toot, toot!  Along came a Great Strong Engine, all finely cleaned up and shining with his number plate scoured and polished and bright.  He had just finished his work of pulling a fine long passenger train, with sleeping cars and a dining car.  That was something to do!  He was puffing and blowing with pride. \\n “O Big, Big Engine!” cried the Train while her Boxcars all joined in the chorus.  “Will you please take us over the mountain?  Our engine has broken down, and we’re loaded with Christmas toys for the children on the other side.  Will you help us, help us, help us?” \\n But the Great Big Passenger Engine blew off steam with a shriek.  He puffed himself up with pride.  He made himself look very huge. \\n “It’s not my business,” he roared, “to pull such a little nobody!  I pull much finer trains with sleeping cars and a dining car.  I can’t be bothered with you!  Puff, Puff!  Ding, dong!  Wheu-eu-eu!” \\n And he switched himself round on a sidetrack, passed the poor little Train-of-Cars and soon left her helpless, far behind. \\n Well, the little Train-of-Cars felt sad but she never left off hoping that some one would come to help her. \\n Pretty soon, toot, toot!  There came a Great Strong Freight Engine.  He had just pulled a freight train over the top of the mountain and was on his way back to the roundhouse to take a little rest.  But the Train called to this Engine, too, while all her Cars joined in the chorus: \\n “O Big, Big Engine, please, will you take us over the mountain?  Our engine has broken down, and we’re loaded with Christmas toys for the children on the other side.  Will you help us, help us, help us?” \\n But the Big Freight Engine snorted.  He snorted and snorted and puffed.  And he sent up  out of his smokestack a shower of angry sparks. \\n “I’ve done enough work for today!  Yess-s-s S-s-sir-ee!” he hissed.  “I’m off for a little rest.  I’ve done enough, done enough.  I’ve done enough, done enough!”  And he switched himself round on the sidetrack, passed the poor little Train-of-Boxcars, and soon left her helpless, far behind! \\n Well, the little Train-of-Boxcars felt sad; she was very, very sad now; but she never left off hoping that some one would come to help her. \\n Pretty soon dragging along there came slowly up the track a rusty, dusty, dingy Engine, just about the size of the one that had been pulling the Train.  He sighed and he moaned and he grunted!  He rumbled and grumbled and groaned.  But the little Train called out while her Boxcars all joined in the chorus: \\n “O Engine, Engine, please, will you take us over the mountain?  Our engine has broken down and we’re loaded with Christmas toys for the children on the other side.  Will you help us, help us, help us?” \\n Then the Dingy, Dusty, Rusty Engine groaned and grunted and grumbled: \\n “I never could pull you!  I couldn’t!  I haven’t the strength!  No, no!  I never could, I never could!  I never could, I never could!”  And he dragged himself round on the sidetrack, passed the poor little Train-of-Boxcars and soon left her helpless, far behind! \\n Well, the little Train-of-Boxcars felt sad; she was very, very, very sad now.  Yet still she never stopped hoping that some one would come to help her. \\n So after a long, long time, along came a Little, Small Engine, an engine so very small it seemed useless to ask her for help; yet she had one bright, lively eye shining out in her head, and she was humming and hurrying, whistling and ringing her bell in the very liveliest way. \\n So the little Train cried out, while her Boxcars all joined in the chorus: \\n “Little Engine, please, could you take us over the mountain?  Our engine has broken down, and we’re loaded with Christmas toys for the children on the other side.  Can you help us, help us, help us?” \\n Now the Little, Small Engine had never been far away from the train freight yard; she had spent all her days in switching boxcars from one track to another track so they could hook up to be pulled by the big train engines.  But think of all those children without their Christmas toys!  She couldn’t let such a thing happen!  So she answered: \\n “I think I can!” \\n Then she came straight up to the Train, caught hold and started to pull!  She tugged and she tugged and she pulled!  And pretty soon, Ding, dong!  Ding, dong!  Puff, puff!  Chug, chug!  The Train-of-Boxcars began to move!  And the Little Small Engine kept toiling, and tugging and tugging and pulling.  And as she tugged she kept puffing, slowly, very slowly: \\n “I—think—I—can!  I—think—I—can!” \\n By and by she ran steadily, smoothly up the track and then she pulled very fast: “I think I can!  I think I can!  I think I can!” \\n At last, at last, and at last she reached the top of the mountain!  She stood on top of the world!  She’d climbed that big long slope!  She’d done it!  She’d done it!  She’d done it!  And there way down below lay the city where the children lived to whom she was bearing the toys.  She gave one puff of joy, just one great big long puff! \\n “I thought I could!” she puffed. \\n Then down she started sliding, faster, faster, faster.  And as she went she kept puffing: “I thought I could!  I thought I could!  I thought I could!  I thought I could!  I thought I could!

= \"There once was a rabbit who was very handsome and smart and especially proud of himself because he was faster than the cats and dogs and squirrels and any of the other animals.  He liked to brag and say, “No one can ever beat me in a race!” \\n The other animals thought he was too much of a show off, but none of them dared to race him.  Then one day when the rabbit was bragging,  the tortoise said, “Mister Rabbit, I’m not so big as you and not so quick, but I will race you.” \\n “What!” said the rabbit, and fell down laughing.  “You’re the slowest animal of all, and you must be the dumbest, if you think you can beat me in a race!” \\n “Maybe so,” said the turtle.  “Maybe not.  Slow and steady is best.” \\n All the animals gathered round, so surprised they didn’t know what to say, except the owl, who nodded, then blinked wisely, then said, “I’ll be the judge of the race.  Follow the path to the big rock, then to the strawberry patch, then to the pond, and then back to here.” \\n “Okay,” said the turtle. \\n “Okay,” said the rabbit. \\n “Ready.  Get set.   Go!” said the owl, and off the turtle started lifting his short little legs and slowly stepping ahead. \\n “Ha, ha!” said the rabbit, and he skipped ahead and then skipped back, and ran a circle around the turtle.  “You short-legged little slowpoke—you’ll never catch me!” \\n “Maybe so, maybe not,” said the turtle.  “Slow and steady is best.” \\n “See you at the big rock!” said the rabbit, “but you better run faster if you want to keep up.” \\n And off he raced with a loud thumping of his big rabbit feet. \\n The turtle didn’t move any faster, and didn’t pay any attention to the rabbit’s bragging, just kept putting one foot in front of the other foot and slowly marched ahead.  After a long hour’s slow walk the turtle came to the rock and there sat the rabbit waiting, combing his whiskers, and yawning, and looking bored.. \\n “What took you so long, slowpoke?” asked the rabbit, and laughed.  “You’d better run faster.” \\n The turtle didn’t answer and didn’t move any faster, just kept putting one foot in front of the other and slowly marched ahead. \\n “All this waiting has made me hungry.  I think I’ll go eat some strawberries, and you’d better run faster or they’ll all be gone!” \\n “Maybe so, maybe not,” said the turtle.  “Slow and steady is best.” \\n And off raced the rabbit with a loud thumping of his big rabbit feet.. \\n After another long hour’s slow walk the turtle came to the strawberry patch and there sat the rabbit, licking strawberry juice off his whiskers, and yawning, and looking bored.  There were no strawberries left. \\n “What took you so long, short legs?” asked the rabbit, and laughed.  “You’d better run faster.” \\n The turtle didn’t answer and didn’t move any faster, just kept putting one foot in front of the other and slowly marched ahead. \\n “All this waiting and eating has made me thirsty,” said the rabbit.  “I think I’ll go have a drink in the pond, and you’d better run faster or the water will be all muddy when you get there!” \\n “Maybe so, maybe not,” said the turtle.  “Slow and steady is best.” \\n And off raced the rabbit with a loud thumping of his big rabbit feet. \\n After another long hour’s slow walk the turtle came to the pond and there sat the rabbit, licking the water off his whiskers, and yawning, and looking bored.  The pond water was all muddy. \\n “What took you so long, green face?” asked the rabbit, and laughed.  “You’d better run faster.” \\n The turtle didn’t answer and didn’t move any faster, just kept putting one foot in front of the other and slowly marched ahead. \\n “All this waiting and eating and drinking has made sleepy,” said the rabbit.  “I think I’ll rest and take a nap, and then I’ll be waiting for you at the finish line.” \\n “Maybe so, maybe not,” said the turtle.  “Slow and steady is best.” \\n And the rabbit plopped down on his back, set his head on a log, and laughed at the turtle, and put his big rabbit feet in the air, but there they didn’t make any loud thumping sounds. \\n After another hour’s slow walk the turtle saw the animals waiting together at the finish line. \\n “Where’s the rabbit?” asked the cat \\n “What happened to the rabbit?” ask the dog. \\n “Is the rabbit coming?” asked the squirrel. \\n The turtle didn’t answer and didn’t move any faster, just kept putting one foot in front of the other and slowly marched ahead.  Just as he was reaching his short little leg across the finish line he heard a loud sound of big thumping rabbit feet, but the turtle had already crossed over the line before the rabbit raced up in a whirl of dust. \\n “The turtle won the race!” said the owl.  “The turtle beat the rabbit.”  All the animals cheered and whooped and howled and celebrated when they saw that the turtle had won. \\n “But I ran much faster,” said the rabbit, “except I got tired and rested!” \\n “Exactly,” said the turtle.  “Slow and steady is best.”\";\n\n    let triggeredWord;\n\n    const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);\n    const [choosenWord, setChoosenWord] = useState('');\n\n    const handleWordClick = (event) => {\n        setIsVisible(!isVisible);\n        console.log(event.target.innerHTML);\n        setChoosenWord(event.target.innerHTML);\n    };\n\n    const onClose = () => {\n        setIsVisible(false);\n    };\n    useEffect(() => {\n\n        /**\n         * Plays audio.\n         */\n        let sound = document.getElementById(\"story\");\n        let btnChecker = document.getElementById(\"closeBtn\");\n\n        if (btnChecker != null) {\n            togglePlay();\n        } else {\n            togglePlay();\n        }\n\n        function togglePlay() {\n            return sound.paused ?
